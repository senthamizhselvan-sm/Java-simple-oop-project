# 📈 Stock Target Tracker (Java OOP Project)

A simple Java project built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles that checks real-time stock prices using an API and tells whether your target price has been reached or not.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches live stock information from an API  
- Checks if the current stock price meets your target price  
- Displays a clear message when the target is achieved  
- Clean OOP-based code structure with classes and methods  
- Easy to extend for multiple stocks

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation:** Stock details and logic are wrapped inside dedicated classes  
- **Abstraction:** API fetching and comparison logic are hidden behind simple methods  
- **Inheritance (Optional):** Can be extended for advanced stock tracking  
- **Polymorphism:** Allows flexible methods for different stock APIs or price checks

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**  
- **HTTP API** (e.g., Alpha Vantage / Finnhub / any stock API)  
- **JSON Parsing** (via built-in or external libraries like Gson)

## 🧩 Example Flow

1. User sets a target price for a stock  
2. The program fetches the current price using an API  
3. It compares current vs. target  
4. Displays output like:
